# game_guessingnumber
This game is created using Javascript where it is played on the terminal of the code editor. 
The code generate a random number where user need to guess the number.
Every wrong guesses will be given a hint to minimize the range of number need to guessed.

Next update (in progress):
1. This game is only one time played then the code will finish thus I will add an option after every win to continue playing or not.
2. I will add a record of number of guesses a user need to take to reach the correct answer.

Ideas:
1. I want to add an array which will accomodate the player name and score (based on number of guesses taken).
2. I am not sure if there is any way for me to save the records for next user's reference thus I'll further explore the possibilities.
